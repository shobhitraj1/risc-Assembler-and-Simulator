# risc-Assembler-and-Simulator
This repository contains a Python implementation of a simple assembler and simulator for a particular Instruction Set Architecture, integrated with automated testing routines. The project was developed for the [Computer Organization](https://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE112) course at IIIT Delhi in Winter 2023.

Features
Assembler: Converts assembly code into machine code for the specified [ISA](https://github.com/shobhitraj1/risc-Assembler-and-Simulator/blob/25c5e0a595713494cf1de1e57eb046e7f70ae93f/CO_project%20_2023.pdf).
Simulator: Simulates the execution of machine code in a virtual environment.
Automated Testing: Includes a suite of automated tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the assembler and simulator.
Usage
Follow these steps to use the assembler and simulator:
